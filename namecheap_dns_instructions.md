dig www.finally.gold +short

# Alternative check
nslookup finally.gold
nslookup www.finally.gold
```

## Expected Results

- `finally.gold` should return:
  - 185.199.108.153
  - 185.199.109.153
  - 185.199.110.153
  - 185.199.111.153

- `www.finally.gold` should return:
  - leolech14.github.io

## GitHub Pages Configuration

Ensure your GitHub repository has:
1. A file named `CNAME` in the root with content: `finally.gold`
2. GitHub Pages enabled in Settings â†’ Pages
3. Source set to deploy from branch (main/master)

## Website Access

Once configured, your site will be accessible at:
- https://finally.gold
- https://www.finally.gold

Both will serve content from: https://leolech14.github.io/ai-events-2025/

## TTL Note
The 1-minute TTL (60 seconds) ensures quick DNS propagation for testing and changes. This is the minimum TTL allowed by Namecheap.

## Troubleshooting

If the site doesn't work after DNS propagation:
1. Check GitHub Pages status: https://github.com/leolech14/ai-events-2025/settings/pages
2. Verify CNAME file exists in repository root
3. Clear browser cache and try incognito/private mode
4. Wait up to 10 minutes for full propagation with 1-minute TTL
